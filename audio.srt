00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,000
Failure not fatal.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,980

Robert Frost, five.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,400
Act as if what you do makes a difference.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,000
It does.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,040
William James.
